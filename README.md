# Melanoma Classifier

A skin cancer diagnostic classifier is introduced in this work. Comparisons are made with several models, showing ways to solve
imabalance data in clinical data. In addition, the importance of calibrating the classification models is implemented and explained. A 
Bayesian neural network is implemented that allows the incorporation of other factors that influence skin cancer.
Finally, it is discussed that a diagnosis with the help of neural networks can be beneficial and more accurate,
improving the diagnostic accuracy of doctors in the detection of melanoma.
